<h2>How to Play</h2>
The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.

Players take turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on empty cells of the grid by clicking on them.

The game ends when one player successfully forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols, or if all cells are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).

To restart the game at any point, click the "Restart" button.
